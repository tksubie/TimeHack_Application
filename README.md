<p> TimeHack is an application that can be used to help Soldiers of the United States military and also users of a Single Channel Ground & Airbourne Radio System. This project will consist of making it easier for operators by having all the information necessary for operating SINCGARS equipment in one place to increase efficiency with the equipment and also aid in teaching how to use the equipment. All of the information will be packed into one application that will be able to be used offline to increase Operational Security (OPSEC) and will utilize the operating personnel’s cellular/mobile device for time and date purposes. </p>

 <p> The application consists of the following information in an easy to read and navigate format: </p>
  <p>•	Zulu date and time consisting of date formatted YYYY-MM-DD and time HH:MM:SS.</p>
  <p>•	Julian day formatted in the DD format, 2-digit format for SINCGARS operation.</p>
  <p>•	Time displayed for the location the operator is in and 1 display of time in a chosen time zone.</p>
  <p>•	TM_11-5820-890-10-3 SINCGARS operator’s Manual (Approved for public release)</p>
  <p>•	TM_11-5820-890-10-6 Pocket Guide SINCGARS ICOM Ground Radios (Approved for public release)</p>
  <p>•	Quick sheet user guide to start up SINCGARS radio in single channel (SC) mode for operation.</p>
